I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way 
is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other 
way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. 

The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, 
insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws 
which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness 
to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological 
constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be 
met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.
