I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way 
is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other 
way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. 

The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, 
insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws 
which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness 
to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological 
constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be 
met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.

If you can't write a function to determine if a given integral input is odd in 
under 10 seconds, you're either a crappy typist or *you shouldn't be 
programming*.

The Spirit of C:
    (a) Trust the programmer. 
    (b) Don't prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done. 
    (c) Keep the language small and simple. 
    (d) Provide only one way to do an operation. 
    (e) Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable. 
    (f) Make support for safety and security demonstrable.

Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely 
with unpredictable results, to having demons fly out of your nose.

It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but 
when there is nothing more to remove.

My point isn't that exceptions are bad. My point is that exceptions are too 
hard and I'm not smart enough to handle them.
